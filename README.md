# Test-runner invoker for local development envs

## Run in development

To run locally, you need to also clone https://github.com/exercism/test-runner-orchestrator at the same level directory as this repo.

Once that's done:
- Populate `config/secrets.yml` with same sort of keys as your local website.
- Run `bundle install`

This will then be invoked by the orchestrator when appropriate.
